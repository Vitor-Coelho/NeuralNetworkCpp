# NeuralNetworkCpp
 
Neural network class created to allow other applications, such as game engine optimizations using genetic algorithms and supervised learning projects.

For now, it only allows creating multilayer neural networks with feedforward method.

The idea is to improve the library to permit creating convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and also training all of these.

It includes the matrix library for linear algebra implementation.
